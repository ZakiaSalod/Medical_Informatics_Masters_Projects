What is it?

The Medical File Tagging Program - 2016 is a software used to tag keywords 
that are found in a text file. The program reads-in a text file, for example,
a medical journal article, Doctor's notes and finds pre-defined keywords
and tags them. The pre-defined keywords are read from another text file.
This program was created by the programmer, as part of a Medical Informatics Programming course
at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine campus in South Africa in
the year 2016.
